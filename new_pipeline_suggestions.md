Thoughts:

1. merge bams from same sample but sequenced in different lanes . Is this already implemented? (Haichao, Paulius)

2. To run the Pipeline, kickstarter must create a .csv file of the fastq files per sample. 
A wrapper would be a quick solution to generate a similar .csv file when using demultiplexed or pre-existing fastqs. (Paulius)
