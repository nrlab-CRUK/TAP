Feedback:

1. merge bams from same sample but sequenced in different lanes . Is this already implemented? (Haichao, Paulius)

2. To run the Pipeline, kickstarter must create a .csv file of the fastq files per sample. 
A wrapper would be a quick solution to generate a similar .csv file when using demultiplexed or pre-existing fastqs. (Paulius)


3. haichao: the alignment.csv is quoted csv, would it be useful to make the pipelien compatible with unquoted csv? which is useful for user-made csv files. 


4. haichao: parameter configureation file,  need to clarify how to set other parameters not shown in the example config, e.g. how to set BED file for filtering. 


5. haichao: `[ISSUE]` The **MarkDuplicates** step, job failed due to `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: java heap space`, and this happened randomly in my test run with 900 bam files. Resume the pipeline will resolve it.   Need to increase the default Mem settings for the java?

6. haichao: `[Minor]` Add spack load openjdf@17 to the run file?  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15274940/205628620-ffabf7ab-c650-4bf2-bb49-6850c03dda07.png)


7. haichao: `[Minor]` in the config file:   `nrlab_tap.config` â†’ `alignment.config` <img width="1222" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15274940/205628766-5e980e90-7848-455a-810a-a4317d7e86b5.png">


8. haichao:  `[Minor]` In the documentation, need to clarify that user need to copy the `/home/bioinformatics/pipelinesoftware/nrlab_tap/nrlabtap-latest.sif` file to assets folder, otherwise the job won't run: <img width="813" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15274940/205629071-80590768-210b-4ace-8865-a476be773ac9.png">

10. haichao: compulsory requirement for the SequencingData format in the aligment.csv file, error occurs when I made my own csv file to for external fq files.

11.  Markduplicates process CANCELLED due to time limit, maybe make the Markdup step time limit longer?

12. Important issue!: missing essential ref files in bioinformatics folders:/mnt/scratcha/bioinformatics/rosenfeld_references
